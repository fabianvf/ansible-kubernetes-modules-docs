#### Synopsis
Retrieve a list of routes. List operations provide a snapshot read of the underlying objects, returning a resource_version representing a consistent version of the listed objects.

#### Options

| Parameter     | required    | default  | choices    | comments |
| ------------- |-------------| ---------|----------- |--------- |
| username  |   |  | |  Provide a username for connecting to the API.  |
| ssl_ca_cert  |   |  | |  Path to a CA certificate used to authenticate with the API.  |
| api_key  |   |  | |  Token used to connect to the API.  |
| force  |   |  False  | |  If set to C(True), and I(state) is C(present), an existing object will updated, and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.  |
| src  |   |  | |  Provide a path to a file containing the YAML definition of the object. Mutually exclusive with I(resource_definition).  |
| cert_file  |   |  | |  Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API.  |
| verify_ssl  |   |  | |  Whether or not to verify the API server's SSL certificates.  |
| resource_definition  |   |  | |  Provide the YAML definition for the object, bypassing any modules parameters intended to define object attributes.  |
| host  |   |  | |  Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.  |
| state  |   |  present  | <ul> <li>present</li>  <li>absent</li> </ul> |  Determines if an object should be created, patched, or deleted. When set to C(present), the object will be created, if it does not exist, or patched, if parameter values differ from the existing object's attributes, and deleted, if set to C(absent). A patch operation results in merging lists and updating dictionaries, with lists being merged into a unique set of values. If a list contains a dictionary with a I(name) or I(type) attribute, a strategic merge is performed, where individual elements with a matching I(name_) or I(type) are merged. To force the replacement of lists, set the I(force) option to C(True).  |
| context  |   |  | |  The name of a context found in the Kubernetes config file.  |
| debug  |   |  False  | |  Enable debug output from the OpenShift helper. Logging info is written to KubeObjHelper.log  |
| key_file  |   |  | |  Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.  |
| password  |   |  | |  Provide a password for connecting to the API. Use in conjunction with I(username).  |
| kubeconfig  |   |  | |  Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection options are provided, the openshift client will attempt to load the default configuration file from I(~/.kube/config.json).  |

              description:
              - Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource
                that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary
                metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying
                objects.

              contains: str, str
            cluster_name:
              description:
              - The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used
                to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different
                clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is
                going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
              type: str
            creation_timestamp:
              description:
              - CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when
                this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before
                order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value.
                It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the
                system. Read-only. Null for lists.

              contains: {}
            deletion_grace_period_seconds:
              description:
              - Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate
                before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp
                is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
              type: int
            deletion_timestamp:
              description:
              - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource
                will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion
                is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client.
                The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource
                lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once
                set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future,
                although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior
                to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
                partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until
                an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
                fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has
                not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion
                is requested. Read-only.

                entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove
                the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is
                non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed.

              - GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate
                a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this
                field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than
                the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make
                the value unique on the server. If this field is specified and the
                generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead,
                it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout
                indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted,
                and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in
                the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is not specified.

              description:

                at object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that
                have not yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has
                been completely initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized
                and is hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't
                explicitly asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object
                is created, the system will populate this list with the current set
                of initializers. Only privileged users may set or modify this list.
                Once it is empty, it may not be modified further by any user.

                    this object is visible. When the last pending initializer is removed,
                    and no failing result is set, the initializers struct will be
                    set to nil and the object is considered as initialized and visible
                    to all clients.
