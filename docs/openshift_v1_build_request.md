#### Synopsis
Manage the lifecycle of a build_request object. Supports check mode, and attempts to to be idempotent.

#### Options

| Parameter     | required    | default  | choices    | comments |
| ------------- |-------------| ---------|----------- |--------- |
| triggered_by_image_name  |   |  | |  Name of the referent.  |
| force  |   |  False  | |  If set to C(True), and I(state) is C(present), an existing object will updated, and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.  |
| revision_git_author_email  |   |  | |  email of the source control user  |
| last_version  |   |  | |  lastVersion (optional) is the LastVersion of the BuildConfig that was used to generate the build. If the BuildConfig in the generator doesn't match, a build will not be generated.  |
| cert_file  |   |  | |  Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API.  |
| labels  |   |  | |  Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.  |
| verify_ssl  |   |  | |  Whether or not to verify the API server's SSL certificates.  |
| revision_git_author_name  |   |  | |  name of the source control user  |
| triggered_by_image_api_version  |   |  | |  API version of the referent.  |
| triggered_by_image_kind  |   |  | |  Kind of the referent.  |
| triggered_by_image_uid  |   |  | |  UID of the referent.  |
| revision_git_committer_name  |   |  | |  name of the source control user  |
| triggered_by_image_resource_version  |   |  | |  Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any.  |
| triggered_by_image_field_path  |   |  | |  If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.  |
| env  |   |  | |  env contains additional environment variables you want to pass into a builder container.  |
| api_key  |   |  | |  Token used to connect to the API.  |
| annotations  |   |  | |  Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.  |
| username  |   |  | |  Provide a username for connecting to the API.  |
| ssl_ca_cert  |   |  | |  Path to a CA certificate used to authenticate with the API.  |
| _from_kind  |   |  | |  Kind of the referent.  |
| triggered_by_image_namespace  |   |  | |  Namespace of the referent.  |
| source_strategy_options_incremental  |   |  | |  incremental overrides the source-strategy incremental option in the build config  |
| revision_git_commit  |   |  | |  commit is the commit hash identifying a specific commit  |
| revision_git_message  |   |  | |  message is the description of a specific commit  |
| _from_field_path  |   |  | |  If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.  |
| _from_api_version  |   |  | |  API version of the referent.  |
| docker_strategy_options_no_cache  |   |  | |  noCache overrides the docker-strategy noCache option in the build config  |
| revision_type  |   |  | |  type of the build source, may be one of 'Source', 'Dockerfile', 'Binary', or 'Images'  |
| _from_namespace  |   |  | |  Namespace of the referent.  |
| _from_resource_version  |   |  | |  Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any.  |
| password  |   |  | |  Provide a password for connecting to the API. Use in conjunction with I(username).  |
| _from_name  |   |  | |  Name of the referent.  |
| name  |   |  | |  Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.  |
| triggered_by  |   |  | |  triggeredBy describes which triggers started the most recent update to the build configuration and contains information about those triggers.  |
| host  |   |  | |  Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.  |
| kubeconfig  |   |  | |  Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection options are provided, the openshift client will attempt to load the default configuration file from I(~/.kube/config.json).  |
| docker_strategy_options_build_args  |   |  | |  Args contains any build arguments that are to be passed to Docker. See  |
| revision_git_committer_email  |   |  | |  email of the source control user  |
| binary_as_file  |   |  | |  asFile indicates that the provided binary input should be considered a single file within the build input. For example, specifying "webapp.war" would place the provided binary as `/webapp.war` for the builder. If left empty, the Docker and Source build strategies assume this file is a zip, tar, or tar.gz file and extract it as the source. The custom strategy receives this binary as standard input. This filename may not contain slashes or be '..' or '.'.  |
| context  |   |  | |  The name of a context found in the Kubernetes config file.  |
| debug  |   |  False  | |  Enable debug output from the OpenShift helper. Logging info is written to KubeObjHelper.log  |
| key_file  |   |  | |  Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.  |
| namespace  |   |  | |  Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.  |
| _from_uid  |   |  | |  UID of the referent.  |

          - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will
            be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
            requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource
            is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and
            not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this value
            may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be
            shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example,
            a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will
            react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the
            pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
            (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the
            API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist
            after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can
            determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion
            of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful
            deletion is requested. Read-only.
