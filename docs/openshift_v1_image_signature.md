#### Synopsis
Manage the lifecycle of a image_signature object. Supports check mode, and attempts to to be idempotent.


#### Options

| Parameter     |  aliases     | required    | default  | choices    | comments |
| ------------- |------------- |-------------| ---------|----------- |--------- |
| annotations  |  |   |  | |  Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.  |
| api_key  |  |   |  | |  Token used to connect to the API.  |
| cert_file  |  |   |  | |  Path to a certificate used to authenticate with the API.  |
| conditions  |  |   |  | |  Conditions represent the latest available observations of a signature's current state.  |
| content  |  |   |  | |  Required: An opaque binary string which is an image's signature.  |
| context  |  |   |  | |  The name of a context found in the Kubernetes config file.  |
| created  |  |   |  | |  If specified, it is the time of signature's creation.  |
| debug  |  |   |  False  | |  Enable debug output from the OpenShift helper. Logging info is written to KubeObjHelper.log  |
| force  |  |   |  False  | |  If set to C(True), and I(state) is C(present), an existing object will updated, and lists will be replaced, rather than merged.  |
| host  |  |   |  | |  Provide a URL for acessing the Kubernetes API.  |
| image_identity  |  |   |  | |  A human readable string representing image's identity. It could be a product name and version, or an image pull spec (e.g. "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel:7.2").  |
| issued_by_common_name  |  common_name  |   |  | |  Common name (e.g. openshift-signing-service).  |
| issued_by_organization  |  organization  |   |  | |  Organization name.  |
| issued_to_common_name  |  common_name  |   |  | |  Common name (e.g. openshift-signing-service).  |
| issued_to_organization  |  organization  |   |  | |  Organization name.  |
| issued_to_public_key_id  |  public_key_id  |   |  | |  If present, it is a human readable key id of public key belonging to the subject used to verify image signature. It should contain at least 64 lowest bits of public key's fingerprint (e.g. 0x685ebe62bf278440).  |
| key_file  |  |   |  | |  Path to a key file used to authenticate with the API.  |
| kubeconfig  |  |   |  | |  Path to an existing Kubernetes config file. If not provided, and no other connection options are provided, the openshift client will attempt to load the default configuration file from I(~/.kube/config.json).  |
| labels  |  |   |  | |  Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.  |
| name  |  |   |  | |  Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.  |
| namespace  |  |   |  | |  Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.  |
| password  |  |   |  | |  Provide a password for connecting to the API. Use in conjunction with I(username).  |
| resource_definition  |  |   |  | |  Provide the YAML definition for the object, bypassing any modules parameters intended to define object attributes.  |
| signed_claims  |  |   |  | |  Contains claims from the signature.  |
| src  |  |   |  | |  Provide a path to a file containing the YAML definition of the object. Mutually exclusive with I(resource_definition).  |
| ssl_ca_cert  |  |   |  | |  Path to a CA certificate used to authenticate with the API.  |
| state  |  |   |  present  | <ul> <li>present</li>  <li>absent</li> </ul> |  Determines if an object should be created, patched, or deleted. When set to C(present), the object will be created, if it does not exist, or patched, if parameter values differ from the existing object's attributes, and deleted, if set to C(absent). A patch operation results in merging lists and updating dictionaries, with lists being merged into a unique set of values. If a list contains a dictionary with a I(name) or I(type) attribute, a strategic merge is performed, where individual elements with a matching I(name_) or I(type) are merged. To force the replacement of lists, set the I(force) option to C(True).  |
| type  |  |   |  | |  Required: Describes a type of stored blob.  |
| username  |  |   |  | |  Provide a username for connecting to the API.  |
| verify_ssl  |  |   |  | |  Whether or not to verify the API server's SSL certificates.  |

        cluster_name:
          description:
          - The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish
            resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field
            is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set
            in create or update request.
          type: str
        creation_timestamp:
          description:
          - CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this
            object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order
            across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented
            in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null
            for lists.
          type: complex
          contains: {}
        deletion_grace_period_seconds:
          description:
          - Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before
            it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is
            also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
          type: int
        deletion_timestamp:
          description:
          - DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will
            be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
            requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource
            is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and
            not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set, this value
            may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be
            shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example,
            a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will
            react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the
            pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
            (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the
            API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist
            after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can
            determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion
            of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful
            deletion is requested. Read-only.
          type: complex
          contains: {}
        finalizers:
          description:
          - Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
            is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
            from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
            in this list can only be removed.
          type: list
          contains: str
        generate_name:
          description:
          - GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a
            unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field
            is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name
            passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided
            value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated
            by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
            If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
            NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with
            Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the
            time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time
            indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is not specified.

        generation:
          description:
          - A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
            Populated by the system. Read-only.
          type: int
        initializers:
          description:
          - An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at
            object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not
            yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has been completely
            initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized and is
            hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't explicitly
            asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object is created, the
            system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only
            privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty, it may
            not be modified further by any user.

                this object is visible. When the last pending initializer is removed,
                and no failing result is set, the initializers struct will be set
                to nil and the object is considered as initialized and visible to
                all clients.

            result:
              description:
              - If result is set with the Failure field, the object will be persisted
                to storage and then deleted, ensuring that other clients can observe
                the deletion.
